For hw3, I implemented kenken/3 and plain_kenken/3 using GNU Prolog, and both of them successfully passed all the test cases given on the website. I also called statistics/0 for measuring performance difference between these two different implementation. For example, using the test case
kenken(
  4,
  [
   +(6, [1-1, 1-2, 2-1]),
   *(96, [1-3, 1-4, 2-2, 2-3, 2-4]),
   -(1, 3-1, 3-2),
   -(1, 4-1, 4-2),
   +(8, [3-3, 4-3, 4-4]),
   *(2, [3-4])
  ],
  T
), write(T), nl, fail. 

It showed the time for computing each result, and the total time is 2ms. While for the same test, call plain_kenken would take a longer time to get all the results. I tested 10 times, and it roughly took 2200ms. Their output are in the same order as given in the example.
